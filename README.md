# pan-personality-detection
Personality recognition from Twitter data using diverse machine learning models.

**Project Overview:**
This repository houses the code and resources for an in-depth project that focuses on advanced personality recognition from Twitter data. The project's core objective is to identify a range of personality traits, including "gender," "age," "extroverted," "stable," "agreeable," "open," and "conscientious," through the use of various machine learning models. It also features an analysis and comparative study of these models.

**Key Features:**
- **Multimodel Approach:** We leverage diverse models, including Support Vector Classification (SVC), Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, and the Roberta language model, for personality recognition based on user tweets.

- **Data Augmentation:** In response to token limitations in language models, we incorporate data augmentation techniques to consider all user data for classical models.

- **Performance Metrics:** Our evaluation framework employs a range of metrics, such as precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC, to gauge the models' efficacy in personality recognition.

- **Multilabel Classification:** Our system expands beyond binary classification, facilitating the identification of multiple personality traits for each user. It operates as a comprehensive multilabel classification solution.
